 Satellites Launch Mini Projects OpenGL Computer graphics


ISRO has made our county proud. They have lauched so many sattelites into the sapce for tele communication,  sciencetific discovery, defence, remote sensing, meteorolog etc. In this article we are going to code satellite launch mini projects using opengl computer graphcis in c/c++. 

We launch satellites into space by putting them on rockets. The rockets carrying satellites launch via a luching station through tons of propellants (fules of rocket). The propellants provide energy to the rocket to get out of Earth gravity 's pull (Speed is called escape velocity). Rocket with even thrust get into space at mutliple stages. The final stage of the rocket is to place the satellite into it orbit.


Design and Implementation 
1. Drawing of Earth -  

2. Drawing of Rocket-

3. Drawing of Satellite - 

Do You Know? 

ISRO have student satellite program. Students who want to working in space technology may develope the payload for satellites with the help of ISRO through thier university.

User Interaction in the program
The Satellites Launch Mini Projects OpenGL Computer graphics program includes interaction through keyboard as mentioned below -

P - Launch the rocket
Q- Quit
